One to ones are a very interesting topic and, as always, everyone has an
opinion. I do too and I'm just going to share mine so please don't take this
as a set of rules. It's just what I've learned in the last few years about it.

First of all two premises:

- I was very skeptical about this kind of meeting at first as I considered it
  a tool for the manager. It isn't. More about this later.
- I now consider one to ones the single most powerful tool a manager has to
  help their team.

Keeping those two points in mind I think there are a lot of questions to
reply about one to ones. The frequency, the outcomes, how to plan them.
Before I get to those points there's one thing to say which I think is the
most important aspect about one to ones. Those meetings are not for you, the
manager. They are very powerful tools as long as the people you're having one
to ones with use the meeting for their own needs. This is absolutely crucial,
the rest of the discussion makes no sense at all otherwise.

Now the details:

  - How to plan them

    I personally don't really plan them. As I said, I consider them a tool for the
    person "on the other side" of the meeting. So I ask them how they want to use
    the meeting as long as we are on the same page. We consider it a tool to make
    us happier. To clarify doubts, misunderstandings. We talk about things that
    aren't related to work if we feel like.

  - The frequency

    I know some people need reminders to set up one to ones. I think this already
    explains very well people miss the point. Once again, it's not for you the
    manager. So you don't get to choose the frequency. My only rule is a upper
    bound: not less often than once per month. Now it's once per month, per week,
    every day or whatever. I don't really care, it doesn't really matter as I'm
    not the one that needs the meeting.

  - The outcomes

    This is the most dangerous part so to say. You definitely don't want to use
    the meeting to set up or review expectations. If you feel those things matter
    to you (I don't necessarily think "setting up expectations is required") have
    a focused meeting about it. The outcome of one to one is a direct consequence
    of the topics you get to discuss during the meeting. It can be very different
    things. It can be something like "let's figure out together how to decrease
    bugs", "please tell me next time I get angry and I don't notice so I can
    improve", "let's work with X on Y  because you both can benefit from the
    experience. Again, it can be whatever.

Generally, I explain those things I have just explained here during the
first one to one I have with people that join my team. And then I take it from
there. If you keep it as free form as possible you'll start seeing a very
interesting phenomenon: each person will use the meeting in a different way.
You'll see some themes being developed more than others depending on the
person. If the experience will vary a lot you're doing it right. People are
different, you don't want to treat them all the same way. You want to be
equally fair with all of them. Some of them need focus on tech things, some
others on soft skills. And that's the very core of my point. It's their
meeting, let them choose what to do with it.

When I sent a first draft of this article to a friend via email his first
reaction was: "the way you just described them, it looks just like 2 people
grabbing a coffee and having a chat, which I seriously believe is good! But
how can you not lose the "meetingness"?". That is actually a good point.  The
idea you may get here is: I think those meetings should be very informal.
But, somehow, that tells me I'm not doing a good job then trying to explain
how I intend one to ones. The point is still the same: you shouldn't be
driving it. It will be more formal with some people and "exactly like going
for a coffee" for other people. Making it serious and official makes it boring
too like most meetings. You have to let the other person go where she wants to
go. You'll love the results.
