If you’re a ruby developer the odds are you use rvm. But if you’re a ruby developer and you don’t use rvm then don’t waist your time reading this post. Stop and go straight to learn about it.
Now let’s get back to our topic. I use rvm on all my machines and sometimes I get confused when I write code in Vim because I don’t remember the current ruby version I’m running. I searched for a plugin in order to get some information about rvm in the statusline and I found rvm.vim. It is nice and works fine but it doesn’t fit with my needs. I use rvm-prompt for my bash prompt and it works really well for me, so I wrote a little function to use it in my vimrc:

{% highlight vim %}
function! RvmStatusLine()
    if ! exists('g:rvm_prompt')
        let g:rvm_prompt = system("~/.rvm/bin/rvm-prompt v g")
        let g:rvm_prompt = substitute(g:rvm_prompt, '\n', '', 'g')
    endif
    return '['.g:rvm_prompt.']'
endfunction
{% endhighlight %}

and then:

{% highlight vim %}
set statusline+=\ %{RvmStatusLine()}
{% endhighlight %}

It works just fine with me because it reflects my current bash configuration.
I thought it would be a nice idea to publish it as a vim plugin. Check it out "here":http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3539.
