In the last two year, I had the opportunity to shift my career toward product
management. It took me a while to accept the job, it was no easy decision.
I needed to be ready for leading a team of people doing a job I never did
before. While I felt ready on the leadership part, I was afraid of not being
able to get up to speed fast enough with the job.

Two years passed and I have learned a lot. On they way, I made a few crucial
mistakes. Of course, making mistakes is part of the game but I want to focus
my attention toward those four or five things that I consider central to
product management. Sometimes, I rethink my personal list of failures in
product management and I come to the conclusion most product people have this
figured out very well and it seems just like "common sense" to me by now. If
I would have to pick just one thing out of those mistakes I am going to share
with you, it would be this:

> Common sense is not so common

This is the very reason why I feel compelled to share mistakes I consider
basic product management now. Furthermore, writing helps me clearing my own
thoughts about things. It is a discovery process and the best part is that
someone else may even find it useful. Well, let's see about that.

I will present my list in no particular order. I would not be able to pick
just one or order my learning by importance. The tricky thing is that all I
have learned in the past two years revealed to be really important.

## Data is nothing. Information is key

Quite recently, we have introduced [blazer](https://github.com/ankane/blazer)
at work,  a little tool I wanted to add it to our toolkit for
a long time. The reaction from other departments' folk was great.
Everyone was happy about the tool. This gave me some food for
thoughts. I started asking myself what it is the real difference between
a product development team providing data for the rest of the company and
everyone being able to ask questions on their own. My assumption is that
people would be happy about shortening the feedback loop. It is like writing
tests instead of deploying code. It generally takes less time to figure out
you broke something with your change if there are tests around. But I was
wrong. My developer background made me focus on the wrong aspect of this
problem. Of course, everyone wants answers faster. No discussion there. I kept
asking myself why as the short lead time could not explain the enthusiasm. And
I started interviewing the people I worked with in other departments. One day
I realised data is nothing. No one really cares about the conversation rate
comparison about two countries. They want to know why is different. The
underlining information is the key here. People can do a better job when they
can extract knowledge out of data. Knowing why a company performs better in
a market is key info. Finding the answer there will improve your marketing
strategy.

Now, as you are probably thinking, this is literally common sense. Without
information, people cannot do a good job.

## Say no to CEO features

## Do not ship what you can't measure

## Get rid of features no one uses

## Mobile first design is an opportunity not a constraint
