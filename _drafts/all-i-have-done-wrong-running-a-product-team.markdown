In the last two year, I had the opportunity to shift my career toward product
management. It took me a while to accept the job, it was no easy decision.
I needed to be ready for leading a team of people doing a job I never did
before. While I felt ready on the leadership part, I was afraid of not being
able to get up to speed fast enough with the job.

Two years passed and I have learned a lot. On they way, I made a few crucial
mistakes. Of course, making mistakes is part of the game but I want to focus
my attention toward those four or five things that I consider central to
product management. Sometimes, I rethink my personal list of failures in
product management and I come to the conclusion most product people have this
figured out very well and it seems just like "common sense" to me by now. If
I would have to pick just one thing out of those mistakes I am going to share
with you, it would be this:

> Common sense is not so common

This is the very reason why I feel compelled to share mistakes I consider
basic product management now. Furthermore, writing helps me clearing my own
thoughts about things. It is a discovery process and the best part is that
someone else may even find it useful. Well, let's see about that.

I will present my list in no particular order. I would not be able to pick
just one or order my learning by importance. The tricky thing is that all I
have learned in the past two years revealed to be really important.

## Data is nothing. Information is key

Recently, we introduced [blazer](https://github.com/ankane/blazer) at work,
a little tool I wanted to add it to our toolkit for a long time. The reaction
from other departments' folk was great. Everyone was happy about the tool, it
was a stimulating process for me. I started asking myself what it is the real
difference between a product development team providing data for the rest of
the company and everyone being able to ask questions on their own. My
assumption is that people would be happy about shortening the feedback loop.
It is like writing tests instead of deploying code. It generally takes less
time to figure out you broke something with your change if there are tests
around. But I was wrong. My technical background made me focus on the wrong
aspect of this problem. Everyone wants answers faster, no discussion there.
I kept asking myself why because the short lead time could not explain the
enthusiasm. I started interviewing the people I worked with in other
departments. One day I came to realise data is nothing. No one really cares
about the conversation rate comparison about two countries. They want to know
why is different. The underlining information is the key here. People can do
a better job when they can extract knowledge out of data. Knowing why
a company performs better in a market is key info. Finding the answer will
improve your marketing strategy and this kind of initiative can change the
story of a company dramatically.

Working with product managers and senior management meant being in
conversations where all you would hear is data. It took me a while to realise
we were confusing data for information. We had no process in place to make
that transformation happening. This is the key learning here for me. I needed
to figure out (faster possibly) we needed a systematic approach to the
transformation process. At the end of the day, it's a simple process: it's
a matter of asking why. Asking questions all the time. You hear data points
and you automatically ask yourself why is that. What is the explanation behind
it. You transform all the data points you hear into information. I believe
that is the process that should back up most of your product stories. And
I believe this three steps process data-why-information should be a big chuck
of the product discovery phase. Most of the time the answer to the big
question "what's next?" is already there. In your data points. You don't know
because you're not systematically asking yourself why.

Now, I'm thinking a lot about how to craft a small process around these steps
we have just discussed. Probably a good topic for another article.

## Say no to CEO features

I define as "CEO features" those a product team build because someone says so
or just because it sounded cool. We fast tracked features without the
necessary scrutiny (here you need a "definition of ready", something I should
have done better too). It was very tricky for me to figure how to handle
those. Here is the problem:

- Your CEO sets up the vision of the company
- You execute that vision translating it into a product roadmap
- You build things from the roadmap

Now the problem lies in the tiny border between vision and roadmap. I think
they should overlap, they should compliment each other. And that's exactly why
this has been so tricky for me. I struggles a lot with the concept, I could
correlate with my CEO saying "we should do this because it's the right thing".
It happened to me often enough with technology. Leading always meant letting
people do what they think it's right while you share with them what you think
it's right. So how do I say no to a "CEO feature"? Would I be still be true to
my own believe of "my job is translating our vision into a roadmap"?

This was hard for me and, as most hard things, it had a very simple solution.
There isn't feature in the sentence "translating the vision into a product
roadmap". It's about the vision and its implementation as a roadmap. And I did
not get a roadmap isn't a set of features. It's a visualisation of your
strategy, an high level concept. Nothing about the CEO vision and the product
roadmap is about the features you build and it took me a while to get that

Once again, it is just common sense. Of course you should not let your "CEO
features" be fast tracked. Of course it makes no sense to fast track any
feature. But I now have a good understanding of the relationship between the
CEO and the product team and I can back up my "No, we won't be doing that just
yet".

## Say no with reason

[Saying no](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=saying+no+product+managment&ia=web)
seems to be a required feature for good product management. I can agree to
that sentiment but I think it statement is incomplete. When I started running
my first product team we did not have enough people and experience to say no.
I struggled with it as I felt a bit alone doing that. It had bad consequences:

- Irrelevant features were creeping into out roadmap
- We would often build the wrong thing and only realise after roll-out
- We would build more than we needed

It was not the nicest situation and it was that rare case in which hiring was
the answer (hint: use hiring as a last resource solution, it brings the best
out of you and the people around you). We hired more people and brought it the
necessary skills. Finally, my team was saying no to features. Oh it felt good,
I was not alone any more. But it had consequence of the rest of the company.
People started feeling frustrated with the new attitude. I did expect it but
I still got something wrong. I thought it was a temporary phenomenon. We just
needed some time to adapt and people would understand why saying no to most
requests was the right thing to do for everyone. Here we go: it's just common
sense again. Why would people understand a no without context?

We were only saying no, we were not telling anyone what is the benefit of
saying no. It turns out this issue is easy to fix: You say no to people and
always give them context about what you are going to do *instead* of what
requested. It's as easy as that. Now, this comes with benefits that go from
your product team to the company and the other way around:

- The rest of the company understands better how you prioritize product work.
  It's vital for them to get it.
- You have to convince people that your prioritisation is the right one. Great
  side-effects:
  - You learn how to express things clearly and in plain English. No jargon,
    no acronyms. It makes your communication more inclusive.
  - You can catch errors in your own prioritisation. They may be right and
    that is a great outcome.

I enjoyed I was doing it wrong. As it is one of those things that once you
realise you can do better you are immediately a better professional.

## Do not ship what you can't measure

I must confess I felt guilty while reading about [feature
factories](https://hackernoon.com/12-signs-youre-working-in-a-feature-factory-44a5b938d6a2#.wkyer1gmt).
We showed clear signs when it came about impact analysis. What I have done
wrong here is realising way too late how important it is to design a process
around impact.

## Get rid of features no one uses

## Mobile first design is an opportunity not a constraint
