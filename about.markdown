I'm 33 years old and I live and work in Berlin, Germany. I'm a really curious person. I'm crazy about carrots. I have a nice [404](/404.html) page.

I love
------

- All well performed music
- Books
- Guitars and playing the guitar
- Photography
- Ruby
- Vim

I love many other things too, but I wouldn't like to share them with the world.

I hate
------

- Dance music
- Racism
- Timesheets
- Internet Explorer

Surely there are a lot more things that I hate, but I don't want to share them with the world.
