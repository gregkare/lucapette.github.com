  <h1>About me</h1>
</div>

<p>I'm 33 years old and I live and work in Berlin, Germany. I'm a really
curious person. I'm crazy about carrots. I have a nice <a href="/404.html">404</a> page.</p>

<article>
  <h2>I love</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>All well performed music</li>
    <li>Books</li>
    <li>Guitars and playing the guitar</li>
    <li>Photography</li>
    <li>Ruby</li>
    <li>Vim</li>
  </ul>

  I love many other things too, but I wouldn't like to share them with the world.

  <h2>I hate</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Dance music</li>
    <li>Racism</li>
    <li>Timesheets</li>
    <li>Internet Explorer</li>
  </ul>

  Surely there are a lot more things that I hate, but I don't want to share them with the world.
