I talk to people about hiring all the time. The reason is pretty obvious: we
need more people to do the things we want to do. More talent. It takes a
collective effort to ship 99% of things we build and that make hiring a
central problem when it comes about building, scaling, running a business. But
do not get me wrong: the actual reason why I am writing about hiring is not
the fact it is so central to the development of our teams and our businesses.
The actual reason is that despite is so central most people approach hiring in
a way that I barely understand.

There are so many things I do not understand about how we interview people,
how we write the ads we post on on job boards, how we treat the candidates
that I have hard times to find a constructive way to talk about this. When I
get this feeling I become more analytical. Analytical thoughts make me calm
again. So let's break the hiring process in parts and then we take it from
there:

- You need ads on job boards
- You have to screen people
- You have to interview them
- You have to either hire them or reject them

I may be simplifying this but at the end of the day, every breakdown is a bit
of a simplification of an actual process so I can live with that.

## Ads on job board

Are you a "jedi" JavaScript programmer? Or maybe a "warlord" backend
developer? A "kickass" application developer? Maybe you are more the classic
type: rockstar or ninja.

I am not sure why this happens. It is plain bullshit and it is stupid, sorry
for being so harsh about it. I have hard times to understand the reasons
behind this culture and to be honest I do not want to know anymore. I learned
to look at the bright side of this aspect of job ads. I avoid companies like
that.  It is a good side effect that I enjoy a lot.

Now, let's move on to the actual content of the ad. About the content itself
there are a couple of patterns I see all the time:

- buzzword, business talk with no actual meaning
- Very strict requirements to meet that are actually just non sense

The buzzwording mostly indicates people are lazy and let their HR people write
the ads for them: I know this is a strong assumption but, let's be honest, did
you ever care about "fast-growing company", "disrupting ideas", "uber for X"?
I guess you did not. And if you spend time writing your own ads most of this
crap will go away. I encourage you to write your own ads for another reason
too: it helps setting requirements that make sense. Some examples of non sense
requirements:

- X years of experience with our awesome stack

  This is really not inclusive. People tend not to believe me when I tell them
  I had to A/B test this in order to understand I was doing it wrong. My
  explanation is the following: most poeple I met in my career would read
  something like "5 years of experience with X" and say "well I read a blog
  post once about X so I guess I'm cool". That is fine, you would be able to
  figure this out while interviewing them anyway. But the actual problem here
  is that a lot of very cool candidates would read that and say "oh I have
  only 4.9 years of experience and that is a strict requirement so I won't
  apply". I generally use a different wording that means something very
  similar and it is more inclusive (in my opinion at least, I would love to
  hear yours on this topic). I write something along the lines of "proven
  experience on multiple projects with X". It covers the 4.9 years case too.

- Degree or equivalent

  Honestly, who cares if you studied or not? Unless it is a strict requirement
  of your project: that happens when you work in specific situations, I had to
  hire a lot of developers with a degree once as I was leading a project for
  the Italian government (yeah we do have some form of "goverment", there's no
  proof it is helpful though) and that was their non-sense requirement. So, in
  short, if you must hire people with a degree please give a proper
  explanation about it in your ad. The only significant difference I found
  while working with people that have a degree is they sometimes start a
  sentence with "I read in this book". Well, I would hardly consider that a
  plus.

- Use of design patterns

  I read this one a lot. What the heck? What do you even mean with this one?
  "If you did not read this book you are not cool"? I really have hard times
  understanding it. I do not think it ever happened to me to say or to hear
  something like "I think we should use the strategy pattern here". It is good
  if you read this book because it is a good (super boring) book. But I can
  hardly justify the requirement in an ad.

Last but not least, I want to underline that it is very likely for candidates
to read about your company for the first time while reading your ad. It is the
first point of contact in most cases and you do not want give people the usual
impression you are just another company out there using the same ad as
everyone else. Even from a very cynical point of view as the conversion rate
of leads into actual new team members you should really care about your ads.

# Screening people

This is harder than it looks like, as with everything else when it comes about
hiring. Sadly here I do not have much to say as the only thing I see happening
often that I do not think it is a good idea is leaving the screening to one
person in your team. If you have more than one team you can play a small game,
you can try to figure out with the teams if people would fit in their team.
There are less chances of getting it wrong and reject someone based on the
fact your team member did not have a good coffee in the morning.  Obviously,
this process may turn to be very expensive and I have had this argument
already. But if you are not willing to spend time about getting people you
probably should not be working with people.

# Interviewing people

# Hiring or rejecting people

Please be fast. That is the only thing I can say I have learned. I have been
slow, sometimes I did not even notify people and that is something I am
ashamed about. It is wrong. We need to respect the people that we interview as
much as we can. So being fast is very important and I do fail it when I do not
have a good process in place.
The other aspect I really try hard to be as good as possible is the actual
feedback I share with people: I hate canned answers.
