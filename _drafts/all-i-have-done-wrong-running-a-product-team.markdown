In the last two year, I had the oppurtunity to shift my career toword product
management. To be honest, it took me a while before accepting the job. It was
no easy decision. I needed to be ready for leading a team of people doing a
job I never did before. While I felt ready on the leadership part, I was
afraid of not being able to get up to speed fast enough with the job.

Two years in and I have learned a lot. On they way, I made a few very crucial
mistakes. Of course, making mistakes is part of the game but I want to focus
my attentions toward those four or five things that I consider central to
product management. Sometimes, I rethink my personal list of failures in
product management and I come to the conclusion most product people have this
figured out very well and it seems just like "common sense" to me by now. But
if I would have to pick just one thing out of those mistakes I am going to
share with you, it would be this:

> Common sense is not so common

This is the very reason why I feel compelled to share mistakes I consider
basic product management now. Furthermore, writing helps me clearing my own
thoughts about things. It is a discovery process and the best part is that
someone else may even find it useful. Well, let's see about that.

I will present my list in no particular order. I would not be able to pick
just one or order my learning by importance. The tricky thing is that all I
have learned in the past two years revealed to be really important.

## Data is nothing. Information is key

Quite recently, we have introducted [blazer](https://github.com/ankane/blazer)
at work. It is a tiny little tool and I wanted to add it to our toolkit for a
long time. The reaction from other departments' folk was incredible. Everyone
was very happy about the tool. This gave me quite some food for thoughts. I
started asking myself what it is the real difference between a product
development team providing data for the rest of the company and everyone being
able to ask questions on their own. My assumption is that people would be
happy about shortening the feedback loop. It is like writing tests instead of
deploying code. It generally takes less time to figure out you broke something
with your change if there are tests around. But I was wrong. My developer
backgroung made me focus on the wrong aspect of this problem. Of course,
everyone wants answers faster. No discussion there. I kept asking myself why
as the short lead time could not explain the enthusiam. And I started
interviewing the people I worked with in other deparments. One day I realised
data is nothing. No one really cares about the conversation rate comparison
about two countries. They want to know why is different. The underlining
information is the key here. People can do a better job when they can extract
knowledge out of data. Knowing why a company performs better in a market is
key info. Finding the answer there will improve your marketing strategy.

Now, as you are probably thinking, this is literally common sense. Without
information, people cannot do a good job.


## Say no to CEO features

## Do not ship what you can't measure

## Get rid of features no one uses

## Mobile first design is an opportunity not a constraint
