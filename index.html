<div class="blog-header">
  <h1 class="blog-title">Hello, people!</h1>
  <p class="lead blog-description">My name is Luca Pette and this is my
  personal website.
</div>

<article>
  <p>
  On this website I publish my writings about things that not only interest me
  but I dare to think they may be interesting for you. Lately, I have been
  writing about:

  <ul>
    <li>people management</li>
    <li>Kanban</li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>The <a href="/articles.html">articles</a> page contains a list all the
  writings I have ever published on this website. Some of my writing is old
  enough I probably disagree with what I myself wrote.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you are really curious about me, my <a href="/about.html">about page</a>
  says a few random things about me. They are all true. I am <a
    href="https://twitter.com/lucapette">@lucapette</a> on
  twitter and I tweet very randomly. That may be a good way of finding more
  about me.
