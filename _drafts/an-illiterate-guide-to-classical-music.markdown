Music has been always a big part of my life. I remember my first attempts of
listening to music in the living room of my mother's best friend apartment. I
was a confused boy, ten or eleven years old. And I have vivid memories of the
first times I run into some of my favourites. Those CDs were a new shiny
media. I was always afraid of scratching their surface. I was an avid reader
of their booklets. But there was something missing. I felt this music was the
kind of collective experience I am not fond of. I was looking for the
introspective feeling you get out of more solitary activities. Reading,
writing. They have been nurturing my brain since for ever. A couple of years
later, I got into metal. And,to me, it was all about the presence of lead
guitars. I started studying the guitar a bit and tried to learn how to read
music. This process got me closed to classical music. I started listening to
some famous composers. I finally saw what I missed in my previous experiences
with music. Classical music had something I have never felt with any other
kind of music. I felt this was the **real** thing. And I started a long
unfinished journey in the land of classical music.

Now, I know how to read music even though I am a slow reader. I can play the
guitar at amateur level. But I have no formal education in music. I had no map
for this fantastic land. I am a classical music illiterate. But despite that I
enjoy classical music more than any other kind of music. I am aiming at making
classical music less intimidating. People often asked me how to get started
with it or which author is easy. I am aiming at making easier to jump on this
train. If I have done it with no education, no help, everyone can!

The thing about classical music is that it looks intimidating. There's so much
of it. All the tracks have those strange and super long names. There are a lot
of Italian words. To be honest, I'm with you. It's confusing. When I got into
classical music I had a lot of questions:

- Do you listen to specific composers?
- What about performers?
- And what about conductors?
- What are all those numbers?
- What's a symphony? A fugue? A quartet?

And so on. The list is much longer but you get the idea. In order to help you
finding your way, I am going to share all the learnings I wish I knew about
when I started this long journey.
