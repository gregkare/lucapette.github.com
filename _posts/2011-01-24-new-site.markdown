Hi everyone,

Finally, I have a new site. For months I've been thinking about the idea of building a new one. I was searching for a new way of handling my semi-static content and I think I've found a system I really like.

The content of the site is generated by [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and the site itself is hosted by [github](http://pages.github.com):

- [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)

  I like it. It is simple and light and has all the features I need for
  my site. It is well-designed and it is simple to use. Jekyll has a
  super lightweight configuration and you can create a site within
  minutes.

- [github](http://pages.github.com)

  I really like the work done by the github guys and I really like git.
  I use it for all my project, I use it even at work (I say *even*
  because I work in Italy, you know). So the idea of pushing a commit on
  a git repository and having my changes published on my site
  immediately is something I find wonderful.

I like my new creation (especially considering my web design limits) and I hope it will help me to post more often.
