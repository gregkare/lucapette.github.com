<div class="blog-header">
  <h1 class="blog-title">Hello, people!</h1>
  <p class="lead blog-description">My name is Luca Pette and this is my
  personal website.
</div>

<article>
  <p>
  Here I mostly publish my writings about things that not only interest me
  but I dare to think they interest you.
  </p>

  <p>
  Recently, I wrote:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="/a-few-words-about-hiring">A few words about hiring</a></li>
    <li><a href="/some-notes-about-one-to-ones">Some notes about one to ones</a></li>
    <li><a href="/my-experience-with-kanban">My experience with Kanban</a></li>
  </ul>
  </p>

  <p>
  The <a href="/articles.html">articles</a> section contains a list all the
  writings I have ever published on this website. Some of my writing is old
  enough I probably disagree with what I myself wrote.
  </p>

  <p>
  If you are really curious about me, my <a href="/about.html">about page</a>
  says a few random things. They are all true. I am <a
    href="https://twitter.com/lucapette">@lucapette</a> on twitter and I tweet
  very randomly. That may be another good way of finding more about me.
  </p>

  Feel free to get in touch. <a href=mailto:lucapette@gmail.com>Email</a> is best.</p>
